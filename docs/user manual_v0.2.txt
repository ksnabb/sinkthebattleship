To test the current application you shuold do the following:

1.
Open the pico.py file inside the battleship application and change the PICO_URL to the pico servers url you want to connect to.

If you do not have a live pico server around you can use the test server. The test server can be run like any other django application
byt typing "python manage runserver 8080"

after this you can access a similar kind of REST as a real pico server on your localhost port 8080:
/pico/rooms
/pico/info/<room_name>
/pico/feed/<room_name>

NOTICE!
The room info might be incomplete
The room_name has to be given but it has no effect on the result provided at the moment
The rooms also gives just some example string

3.
Run another django test server (if you have the test pico server running choose another port e.g.

> python manage runserver 8000

4.

Open your browser and go to address http://localhost:8000/battleship/room/danceroom/

You should now see an HTMl page with a room and its sensors.
